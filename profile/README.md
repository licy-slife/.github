<h2>Purpose of Slife</h2>
<p>Slife is a time-tracking and activity-monitoring application developed by Slife Labs, designed to automatically track how much time a user spends on applications, documents and websites - eliminating the need for manual time sheets.</p>

<h2>Main Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Automatic tracking of applications, documents, and Web sites usage - logs time spent without manual input.</li>
  <li>Visualization tools and analytics: multiple views (by day, month, application, web or activity) to analyze usage patterns.</li>
  <li>Grouping of activities / categorization - you can define contexts (e.g. "work", "study", "browse") to merge related apps/sites into one activity.</li>
  <li>Productivity goals and notifications - set targets (e.g. max time on non-work websites) and get alerts when exceeded.</li>
  <li>Background operation: once running, Slife tracks new apps without manual setup.</li>
  <li>Option for sharing activity history via a (now-legacy) social service "Slifeshare".</li>
</ul>

<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>Slife is aimed at freelancers, consultants, designers, students or anyone who wants to monitor how they spend time on computer - either for billing clients, understanding personal productivity, or limiting distractions.</p>

<h2>Advantages of Using Slife</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Fully automatic: no need to manually start/stop timers. </li>
  <li>Provides detailed insight into digital habits - usage by app, document, website or custom activity groups.</li>
  <li>Helps with productivity management through goals and notifications. </li>
  <li>Useful for billing or time-logging for freelancers and consultants. </li>
  <li>Lightweight and minimal - historically had modest system requirements.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Functional Modules</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Activity Logging Engine - monitors application, document, web usage automatically.</li>
  <li>Analytics & Visualization - multiple graphs and usage breakdowns by time, app, activity. </li>
  <li>Activity Grouping and Categorization - custom grouping of apps / sites into meaningful contexts.</li>
  <li>Goal & Notification Module - set productivity goals and get alerts. </li>
  <li>Optional Sharing / Collaboration (legacy) - via "Slifeshare" service for social time-sharing.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Supported Platforms & Technical Requirements</h2>
<p>Originally Slife was developed for Mac OS X (versions 10.5 or later) and required minimal hardware (e.g. ~512 MB RAM, small disk space).</p>
<p>Some download sites list older builds for Windows (e.g. XP / Vista) - but the official documentation and trusted reviews emphasize Mac support.</p>

<h2>Limitations / Known Issues</h2>
<ul>
  <li>No advanced reporting filters (e.g. filter by time of day) - some reviewers note limited report customization.</li>
  <li>Data export functionality seems limited or absent (per some user reviews).</li>
  <li>Original "Slifeshare" social tracking may raise privacy concerns - users may not wish to publicly share activity logs.</li>
  <li>Unclear current maintenance status - most coverage dates to 2007–2009, so compatibility with modern Windows or macOS versions may be problematic. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Typical Use Cases</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Freelancers or consultants who need to track time spent per project for billing. </li>
  <li>Individuals interested in monitoring and improving personal productivity and digital habits. </li>
  <li>People wanting to audit how they spend time on apps, websites or documents to reduce distractions. </li>
  <li>Small teams (historically, via Slife Teams / Slifeshare) wanting shared activity overview.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Licensing and Availability</h2>
<p>Slife was offered as a paid application (~US $34) or a free trial (limited to tracking 3 applications).</p>

<h2>Status Notice</h2>
<p>Given the lack of recent updates and the fact that credible sources describe Slife primarily as a Mac OS X application, its compatibility with modern Windows versions is uncertain. Use of Slife on Windows may require testing or alternative time-tracking tools might be more reliable.</p>
